#|1. Write a function powerfour that given an integer n, returns true if n is a power of 
four, else returns false. An integer n is a power of four, if there exists an integer x 
such that n == 4x.  
Not included in this assignment, but a frequent followup question in interviews: 
Could you solve it without loops/recursion? Probably a good idea to at least look 
at solutions that solve the above question without loops/recursion.|#

#|2. Write a function insert-at that inserts an element at a given position into a list. Your 
solution must use recursion.|#


#|3. Write a function palindromep that is given a list and returns 1 if the list has the 
same sequence of elements when read left to right as when read right to left. It 
should return 0 otherwise.|#

#|4. Write a function ifPrime that determines whether a given integer number is prime or 
not. Return 0 if it is prime, 1 if it is not prime.  |#
